# aeKee
Simple client-side Javascript only PBKDF2->AES->HMAC and back encryption/decryption implementation.

Makes use of, with thanks, portions of both CryptoJS and SaltThePass:

https://github.com/brix/crypto-js

https://github.com/nicjansma/saltthepass.js/tree/master

Uses the same encryption/decryption algorithm as used at https://aekee.com for secure vaults, password generator and secure notes.
